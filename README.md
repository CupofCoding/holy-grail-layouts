CSS Flexible Box Layout (Flexbox) — The holy grail is a web page layout which has multiple, equal height columns that are defined with style sheets. 

Holy Grail is a layout pattern that’s very common on the web. It consists of a header, a main content area with fixed-width navigation on the left, content in the middle and a fixed-width sidebar on the right and then a footer.

Created flexbox based stying and grid based for seperation of concerns.
